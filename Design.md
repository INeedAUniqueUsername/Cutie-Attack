# Cutie Attack Design Document

## Backstory
Some moldy Bad Apples caused a bunch of Cuties to spoil. Now the Cuties are mad and want to get revenge on the Bad Apples by smashing their toy castles. 

## Setting
The game level looks like a miniature playset on a table that is about waist height with the player. The background should look like a children's playroom.

## Gameplay
- Inspect the enemy castles
- Identify weak spots and plan angles of attack
- Launch oranges on the slingshot.

The player has a table of oranges and may choose which order to fire them in.

The player gets score for destroying blocks and apples, getting an extra 10000 points per spare orange at level end.

The level ends when the player runs out of oranges or all the apples are destroyed.

The strength of VR is that it adds depth to the strategic element. The player must physically inspect the playing field in order to develop strategy. Furthermore, being able to pick up the missiles and launch them on the slingshot emphasizes the element of action.

# Level Design
Advanced levels consist of sprawling castles that surround the slingshot and provide multiple angles.
